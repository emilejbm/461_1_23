# Building program
In command line, first run 
`go build -o "run"`
in order to create executable with 'run' as name.

# CLI
<`build`, `install`, `test`, `'URL_FILE'`> commands are recognized where 'URL_FILE' must be an absolute path to a file in the system.

# Architecture
![Architecture](resources/arch.jpg)   
This is the current architecture of our program. Each block represents a collection of functions towards a single functionality. Each color represents a package in Go.

# Helpful Commands
`go run .`   
`go build .`

# GitHub API Notes
Use environment variable "GITHUB_TOKEN" to set token

# Commands
`./run install` to install Go and Python dependencies  
`./run build`  to build the executable  

The following commands require install and build beforehand:  
`./run URL_FILE` to run main program  
`./run test` to run test cases
